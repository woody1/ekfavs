<h2 class="text-center mb20">General Rules For The Show</h2>

<div class="rules">

<ol>
    <li>All Classes are open to everyone resident in East Knoyle. Individuals may enter as many classes as they wish, but may only have <span class="highlight">one entry</span> per class. (See also paragraph 10 below)</li>
    <li>The cost of entry is &pound;2 for up to 10 classes. A further 10 (or fewer) class entries will be charged an additional &pound;2. Children&rsquo;s entries are <span class="highlight">free</span>. Payment can be made online on submission of the completed entry form (see point 3 below)</li>
    <li>Entries</li>
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li>Entry forms can be found <a href="entry_form/">here</a>. Exhibitors should complete these forms online, listing all classes entered, and follow online instructions on how to submit their completed forms along with payment.</li>
        <li>Completed entries <span class="highlight">MUST</span> be sent via the website by midnight on <?= $deadline ?>. <span class="highlight">No online entries can be accepted after this time.</span></li>
        <li>Late entries will be accepted on Thursday 12th August between 17:00 and 19:30 only if brought <span class="highlight">in person</span> to the Village Hall, along with the relevant entry fee.</li>
        <li>Exhibits should be taken to the Village Hall, either between <span class="highlight">16:00 and 19:00</span> on the evening before the show <span class="highlight">(Friday)</span>, or between <span class="highlight">08:30 and 10:30</span> on the morning of the show <span class="highlight">(Saturday)</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Exhibitors will be given an <span class="highlight">entry card</span> for each of their entries. This will show the class number and name. This card should be placed adjacent to the entry as directed by a steward. No name or owner identification marks should be visible. The steward will record prizes awarded by the judge.</li>
    <li>Unless the show schedule specifically states otherwise, any plant, flower, vegetable, or any other product exhibited in the competition <span class="highlight">must be the property of the person in whose name it is entered.</span> It must have been grown or made by the exhibitor, been in their possession, or cared for by him/her for at least two months prior to the date of the show.</li>
    <li>In the flower arrangement classes (7 and 12), purchased materials may be used. Pot plants must have been in the exhibitor&rsquo;s possession for at least three months before the show date.</li>
    <li>All exhibits will be regarded as having been donated to the organising committee for sale, except in the Pot Plant and Cactus classes, thus allowing the exhibits to be auctioned at the end of the show.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Exhibitors who specially desire that any of their exhibits be returned should place a &lsquo;Not for Sale&rsquo; notice on the front of their exhibit cards. The disposal of the exhibits not sold at the auction will be at the discretion of the committee.</span></li>
    <li>An exhibit may be cut or opened by the judges for inspection and/or tasted. Any competitor who refuses to permit this will be automatically disqualified.</li>
    <li>As explained in paragraph one, in the flower and vegetable classes, an exhibitor may only make one entry per class. In other words, two or more persons may not compete separately in the same class with produce from the same garden or allotment. For this purpose, the term <span class="highlight">&lsquo;Exhibitor&rsquo;</span> includes all <span class="highlight">adult</span> members of the family unit living at the same address. If members of a household wish to share the credit and prizes, then the exhibits should be entered in joint names.</li>
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li>Except in the Vegetable Classes, children may enter the same classes as their parents with their own exhibits if they have made them themselves, e.g. Jams, cakes, flower arrangements, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>In the children&rsquo;s classes, the work must be solely the effort of the exhibitor. No assistance should be given in constructing or assembling the exhibit.</li>
    <li>Exhibitors should provide their own containers. All cakes should be placed on a disposable plate or cake board. The organisers cannot be held responsible for loss of plates or vases - it is the responsibility of the exhibitor to ensure that their utensils and containers are collected.</li>
    <li>Exhibitors must comply with the show Stewards&rsquo; directions who shall determine the placing of all exhibits. <span class="highlight">Entries that do not conform to the schedule will be disqualified, therefore please read the schedule carefully.</span></li>
    <li>Judging will begin at 11:00 and whilst in progress only accredited show officials will be allowed to remain in the hall.</li>
    <li>The judges&rsquo; decisions are final. Judges finding themselves in doubt about any matter shall be at liberty to consult with the show&rsquo;s Chairperson who will be the sole arbiter in matters pertaining to the application of the rules for the show.If there is a dispute over entries that cannot be resolved before judging commences, then the show Chairperson has the right to annul the Class. The exhibits will remain on the show bench but will not be judged.</li>
    <li>The cups, trophies and prizes will be awarded on the following basis: </li>
    <ul>
        <li>1st in class - 4 points</li>
        <li>2nd in class - 3 points</li>
        <li>3rd in class - 2 points</li>
        <li>In any Class where there are less than three entries, prizes will be awarded at the discretion of the Judge.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All cups and trophies are the property of the East Knoyle Flower and Vegetable show. The winner may retain the cup or trophy for one year but it should be returned to the show Chairperson in good clean condition when asked for.</li>
    <li>Reasonable care will be taken of all exhibits, but the show committee cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>And finally… The organisers have planned the show using guidelines set out in the “Horticultural Show Handbook”, the official RHS guide to organising, judging and competing in a show. That is the source of the above rules; they are certainly not all-inclusive, but aim to form the basis for a fun day.</p>
