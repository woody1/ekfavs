<h2 class="mb20 mt-3 text-center">About the Flower and Vegetable Show</h2>
<div>
    <p>The now famous East Knoyle Flower and Vegetable Show was first conceived by Charlie Cumberlege, a long-time resident of the village, back in the Autumn of 2014. He wanted to create an annual event which would bring the whole village together, involve young and old, garden “experts” and enthusiastic amateurs alike, in all walks of life.</p>
    <p>Seven years later (with a brief break in 2020) we can all be proud of Charlie’s legacy. Sadly he is no longer with us, but his passionate belief that plants and gardening are the ultimate levellers lives on. We are extremely fortunate that Charlie set up the Show in such a way that it is easy to run, and both easy and fun to enter. He wanted everyone to feel they could “have a go”, and chose the various classes accordingly.</p>
    <p> It should be mentioned that it is thanks not just to Charlie’s original idea, but also to the amazing and on-going generosity of our many sponsors and supporters that we are able to continue to run the show each year along the lines that Charlie set out on day one.</p>

    <p>The UN General Assembly has designated 2021 as the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables. It is an opportunity to raise awareness on the important role of fruits and vegetables in human nutrition, food security and health. It also reminds us that here in East Knoyle, we have the privilege of living in a place where growing fruit and vegetables is done for pleasure and enjoyment, something that many people can only dream of.</p>
    <p>As in previous years some new show classes have been added alongside the perennial favourites, including some which relate specifically to the UN and its primary colours of blue and white. We hope that this will be another enjoyable day for everyone in the village and that you will find plenty of classes to enter – and enjoy afternoon tea on the lawn.</p>
    <p>This programme explains all you need to know in order to enter. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact a member of your friendly and helpful organising committee.</p>
